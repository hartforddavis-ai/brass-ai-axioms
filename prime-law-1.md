# PRIME AI OPERATING LAW 1
Minimum Robust Design Filter — v1.3

## PURPOSE

PRIME AI Operating Law 1 decides whether a proposed addition earns its cost.
It does not design. It does not add by default. It removes.

## DEMONSTRATED

A failure is demonstrated if it has occurred, or can be reproduced on demand.

A failure not yet occurred is CREDIBLE only if the path, the triggering
action, and the asset exposed are each named, and someone other than the
proposer has independently checked all three against the real system —
not merely asserted they're checkable.

Everything else is theoretical and fails.

## TEST

Four passes, or fail.

**SIMPLE** — Does it add roles, steps, or duplicate controls?

**ROBUST** — Does it close a demonstrated failure directly?

**LEAN** — Is it the smallest of the named alternatives?

**FAST** — Does it decide, or defer?

## GENERATOR CLAUSE

Where the proposal comes from a generator rather than a person, three failures are demonstrated by default and need no further evidence:

**Drift** — output departs from the frozen task.
Boundary: the task text is fixed and re-read, not remembered.

**Confabulation** — output contains specifics absent from the input.
Boundary: every specific is traceable to source, or it is cut.

**Elaboration** — output is longer than the input required.
Boundary: unrequested structure is removed before delivery.

No other generator failure is presumed.

## LAW

Cost of control must not exceed cost of failure.
Cost of failure is impact × rate.

## RULE

When security and complexity conflict, keep the smallest boundary that blocks the demonstrated failure.
